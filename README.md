# Performance Analysis Suite of an Image Detection application
# INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this application is to improvise the efficiency of a particular application(Eg. Image detection application). While this application is tested with large volume of images as Input, that input is affecting the impact of the performance anyway. To improve this  efficiency, PA Suite works by measuring CPU utilization factors, Memory usage capability, Accessing speed and computing operations. This project is developed and build by using Cmake cross platform to run in any platform.
